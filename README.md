Self-Titled-Debut-Album-API 🎤🖥️🔀
========================
[![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=self-titled-debut-album-api&style=flat)](https://self-titled-debut-album-api.herokuapp.com/)

##About
An API used to generate random band names as well as genres and Twitter-style messages. This project is the spirtitual successor to [Self-Titled-Debut-Album](https://github.com/mpolson64/Self-Titled-Debut-Album), a previous project that became increasingly annoying. Names are generated by asking [Wordnik's API](http://developer.wordnik.com/) for random words of specific parts of speech and combining them in preset patterns (ex. The Plural Nouns → The Beatles). Feel free to use for whatever projects you would like!

##Usage
The API has 4 paths:

###[`/full`](https://self-titled-debut-album-api.herokuapp.com/full):

###[`/bandname`](https://self-titled-debut-album-api.herokuapp.com/bandname):

###[`/genre`](https://self-titled-debut-album-api.herokuapp.com/genre):

###[`/message`](https://self-titled-debut-album-api.herokuapp.com/message):
